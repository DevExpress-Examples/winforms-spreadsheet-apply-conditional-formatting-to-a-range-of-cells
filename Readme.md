# Spreadsheet Document API - How to Apply Conditional Formatting to a Range of Cells

This example illustrates how to get started with conditional formattingÂ that can be applied to cells that match a certain condition specified by a conditional formatting rule.

In particular, this sample demonstrates how to use the SpreadsheetControl API to create the following types of conditional formatting rules:

* a rule that formats cells whose values are above or below the average
* a rule that highlights cells whose values are between or not between two specified values
* a rule that formats top or bottom-ranked values;
* a rule that highlights cells containing the given text;
* a rule that formats unique or duplicate values, blank cells, and formula errors;
* a rule that highlights cells containing dates in the specified time period;
* a rule that formats cells whose values meet the condition expressed by the relational operator;
* a rule that uses a formula to determine which cells to format;
* a two-color scale conditional formatting rule;
* a three-color scale conditional formatting rule;
* a data bar conditional formatting rule;
* an icon set conditional formatting rule.
